# OscarPolytope
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lkastner/OscarPolytope.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lkastner/OscarPolytope.jl)

Convenience wrapper around
[Polymake.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/Polymake.jl) for more textbook
like use. The implementation follows along the lines of [Joswig, Theobald:
Polyhedral and Algebraic Methods in Computational
Geometry](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9781447148166).

Have a look into `test` directory for sample use.
